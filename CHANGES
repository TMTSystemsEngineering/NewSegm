REVISION HISTORY

TMT.OPT.TEC.07.044.CCR15
  Changed "Eric Ponslet" in output header to release number "TMT.OPT.TEC.07.044.CCR15".
  Fixed typo causing last column of 11C to print B&W rather than Noll Zernike's.
  Fixed 1E showing radii for range of M1 vertices, rather than stated diameter.
  Added note clarifying section 11 coordinate systems; t is a rotation from SCRS.
  Added note to section 4 calling out the plane defining the hex sides; this plane is called out nowhere else.

TMT.OPT.TEC.07.044.CCR14
  Changed REL14 to CCR14: TMT.OPT.TEC.07.044.CCR14 (B. Sutin, 20151016 - Changes made to compiled TXT file, ref. CR192; Compiled file generated from REL13; Initial CCR release)
  A vendor has found potential errors with the Zernike coefficients, so section 11 has been temporarily removed until corrections
  are made.  Section 12 has been retained, but should be used with caution.

TMT.OPT.TEC.07.044.REL13
  This version has a second set of S1 Prob-Points corresponding to DATUM-A Targets at R=670 contained in Section 10C. These are in 
  addition to the Probe Points in Section 10B which are opposite the countersinks on S2.  This version also has the Segment prescriptions
  defined in the PSA coordinate systems in Section 11D.

TMT.OPT.TEC.07.044.REL12
  This version has updated coordinates for the Subcell Alignment Targets that are consistent with the M1S-STR ICD specification of the 
  Metrology Fixture SMR target locations. These coordinates are shown in Section 10 of this document.

TMT.OPT.TEC.07.044.REL11
  This version includes a correction for the edge sensor pocket coordinate system values.  
  This version also includes Section 12: a summary of the segment clocking angles (angle between M1CRS_R to PSACRS_X)

TMT.OPT.TEC.07.044.REL10
  This version has corrected definitions of the mirror cell nodes in Section 8.  As a result, the AAP locations in Section-7 have been updated,
  and also the radius of the fixed frame holes (AAP interfaces) in Section 1-G has also changed.
